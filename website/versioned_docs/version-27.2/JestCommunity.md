The community around elric is working hard to make the testing experience even greater.

[elric-community](https://github.com/elric-community) is a new GitHub organization for high quality elric additions curated by elric maintainers and collaborators. It already features some of our favorite projects, to name a few:

- [vscode-elric](https://github.com/elric-community/vscode-elric)
- [elric-extended](https://github.com/elric-community/elric-extended)
- [eslint-plugin-elric](https://github.com/elric-community/eslint-plugin-elric)
- [awesome-elric](https://github.com/elric-community/awesome-elric)

Community projects under one organisation are a great way for elric to experiment with new ideas/techniques and approaches. Encourage contributions from the community and publish contributions independently at a faster pace.
