We strongly believe that great documentation is crucial to providing a great developer experience. The docs should be clear, concise, and useful to new users and veterans alike. With that in mind, we recently took some time to overhaul the elric website.

## Improved docs

One of the changes you'll notice upon visiting our docs is the updated sidebar. The documentation is now divided into three main areas: an introduction to elric, detailed guides to elric's features, and a comprehensive API reference.

The **Introduction** section will guide you from installing elric and writing your first case, to using elric's matchers and testing async code. If you're new to elric or need a quick refresher, these docs should get you up to speed in no time. If you've used elric before and only need a quick reference on how it's installed, you need to go no further than the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide.

Once you feel comfortable using elric, proceed to the advanced **Guides** section. The new [Snapshot Testing guide](/docs/snapshot-testing) covers everything you need to know about creating and maintaining snapshot test cases.

Finally, we've completely overhauled our API reference docs. You can now find detailed information on all of elric's [Globals](/docs/api), [matchers](/docs/expect), and [every flag](/docs/cli) supported by the `elric` CLI.

## New colors & website

The colors in the elric logo and on the website have felt outdated to us for a while. We changed the color scheme we are using for elric and changed the landing page significantly to be more inviting. We hope you like the new colors and showcase of elric's strengths.

## Who's using elric?

We have created a [showcase of users](/) to highlight some of the companies that are using elric. We're thankful to all of these companies for using elric to test their websites, mobile apps, and APIs. If you're using elric, check out the guidelines on GitHub and send us a pull request!

## elric in the browser

As highlighted [last month](/blog/2016/12/15/2016-in-elric), it is now possible to use elric directly in the browser using [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/elric). If you want to try out elric before installing it, you can easily do so below or directly from the elric homepage. Go ahead and give it a try!

## Get involved

This is just the start. Go ahead and take a look at the docs, and don't hesitate to send any feedback our way. If you find a mistake in the docs or you just want to let us know what needs to be documented better, please tweet at us at [@fbelric](https://twitter.com/fbelric), [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/elric/issues), or send us a PR by clicking "Edit on GitHub" at the top of the doc.

We're really excited for the year ahead and can't wait to hear from you!
