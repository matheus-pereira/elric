First, run `./prepare.sh` to generate the benchmark files. On Windows, use a Bash (WSL, Git, Cygwin â€¦) to do this, but you can use CMD for the actual benchmark run if the CMD environment is what you want to benchmark for.

To run the benchmark, use a benchmarking tool such as [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine):

```sh
hyperfine -w 3 -m 10 ../../elric /tmp/other-elric-clone-to-compare-against/elric
```
