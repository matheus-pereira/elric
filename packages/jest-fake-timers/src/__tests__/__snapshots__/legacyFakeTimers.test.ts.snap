exports[`FakeTimers runAllTimers warns when trying to advance timers while real timers are used 1`] = `
A function to advance timers was called but the timers API is not mocked with fake timers. Call \`elric.useFakeTimers()\` in this test or enable fake timers globally by setting \`"timers": "fake"\` in the configuration file. This warning is likely a result of a default configuration change in elric 15.
